# Diabetes_Dataset_Modeling
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning (ML) model development on a diabetes dataset. 
The dataset contains various clinical and demographic features used to predict diabetes-related outcomes. 
After performing EDA to understand the data distribution and key features, multiple machine learning models were tested to predict the target variable. 
The XGBoost (XGB) model provided the best performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
